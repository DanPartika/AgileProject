============================

* Fork the BrainBrowser repository.
* Install the npm modules (`npm install` from repository root).
* Create a separate, well-named branch for each contribution.
* Maintain a consistent coding style with the rest of the codebase (see the [Style Guidelines](https://github.com/aces/brainbrowser/blob/master/STYLE.md)).
* Test your modifications against the appropriate [example application](https://github.com/aces/brainbrowser/tree/master/examples).
* Lint your code and run the unit tests (`grunt test`).
* Submit a pull request.
* Once finished with a contribution, do not push any more commits to the contribution branch. New commits will continue to appear in the pull request.
