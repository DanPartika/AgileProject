# Presurgical Epilepsy Evaluation Platform

A web application that surgeons can use to evaluate their patients brain before conducting a operation. 

## Description

Construct a presurgical epilepsy evaluation system by pinpointing sources of brain activity using EEG data and rendering a 3D visualization of the brain. Build a user-friendly application that will be convenient for surgeons to use and aid in their decision-making. We will develop a user-friendly experience through features such as its simple yet intuitive visual interface and an easy-to-navigate UX. We aim to give surgeons/doctors a more hands-on experience through our 3D model which wouldnâ€™t be possible through the typical EEG report/data that they normally receive. Our solution will be a data-driven visual experience for the surgeons to better comprehend patient brain activity data and make it easier to make more informed decisions/diagnoses about surgical procedures for epilepsy patients. A key feature will be the surgeons' ability to highlight certain parts of the brain in different colors to more easily differentiate portions of the brain that they should focus more on. This in turn will lead to faster and more efficient analysis of data for the surgeons, improving the rate at which they can provide care.
